            Dr. Satish Kumar is a distinguished aerospace Scientist of national repute with outstanding contribution to
            the missiles and strategic systems. He has unique distinction of leading important strategic establishments
            over a decade and laying the foundation for futuristic technological growth in critical areas. A graduate in
            Aeronautical Engineering from Punjab Engineering College, Chandigarh, he obtained Masters degree in
            Aerospace from IIT, Kanpur and Doctorate in Mechanical Engineering from REC, Warangal.

        <p>
            He played a key role in the development of first ever indigenously developed Liquid propellant (LP) rocket
            engine for Prithvi missile. He was instrumental in productionization of highly complex LP engines at
            Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and private industry. His contribution in development of Cold and Hot
            gas Reaction Control systems led to better control of missile systems at higher altitudes, thus increasing
            the accuracy of the missiles. He played a vital role in the development of Propellant transfer systems and
            Storage facilities at various forward Army locations. His dynamic leadership played a key role in providing
            training to Army personnel and support Induction process for Prithvi missile into the Armed Forces arsenal.
        </p>
        <p>
            He has done pioneering work in the field of Supersonic Combustion in India and its related test facility at
            DRDL, Hyderabad in collaboration with premier institutes. This has culminated in a major hypersonic
            technology development program today. As, Director Missiles and Head, Programme Office at DRDO HQ, he played
            a vital role in the finalization of Mission Mode projects like MRSAM and LRSAM missiles with Israel.

            Dr. Satish Kumar served as an Outstanding Scientist and Director of Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory
            (TBRL) Chandigarh, which is a DRDO laboratory that deals with development of conventional and
            non-conventional weapon systems. He transformed TBRL into a vibrant and proactive laboratory through his
            technology drive and initiatives. Considering the future requirements of strategic systems, he took
            initiatives for development and realisation of critical technological facilities which were denied to India
            by technologically superior nations. Within TBRL, he initiated a series of new projects, which upon fruition
            with fulfil the needs of India’s Strategic program in the years to come. He was at the helm of the Strategic
